# ðŸ§  Rozee.pk Job Listings Scraper (Playwright + Stealth Mode)

This project scrapes job listings from [Rozee.pk](https://www.rozee.pk) using **Playwright** in stealth mode.
It searches for a specific job title, city, and salary range, then extracts all available jobs with full details (title, company, location, link) â€” and saves them into a CSV file 
and handle pagination if there successfully

â”œâ”€â”€ job_listing_scraper.py # Extracts job listings, opens details, paginates,and save to csv
â”œâ”€â”€ browser_config.py      # Creates stealth browser context

ðŸ§­ My Journey to This Project

I initially built this automation using Selenium, and it worked well for basic interactions.
However, when I reached the scraping stage, I discovered that heavy JavaScript rendering on Rozee.pk required a more advanced tool.
That's when I switched to Playwright, and began learning it from scratch â€” exploring everything from sync vs async models to stealth techniques for bypassing bot detection.
I implemented this entire project using async Playwright, with a modular and scalable architecture.

ðŸ‘‰ This shift not only improved scraping performance, but also gave me deeper insight into real-world automation and scraping challenges.
